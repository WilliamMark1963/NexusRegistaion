### Welcome To Nexus Academy Registration form
I developed this form using fallowing technologies
    - HTML
    - CSS (Tailwind Framework)
    - Javascript

I faced alot of challenger during the devlopement. The  Challenges are 
    - Storing the data in Local Storage and Rendering it on first time
    - Deletinf the data using a meta variable called dataIndex which store the index of that object.
    - Displaying Registration number on the form and stroing it in table
    - popups for every error 
    - validating the forms

### Things you learn by preparing it

You can learn alot of things while preparing it like regEx validation, Displaying popups, etc.

## What are the operations you can perform
You can perform CRUD operations on every object stored in the table
